MLOps Pipeline for Machine Learning Model Deployment
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete MLOps pipeline designed to automate the training, deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models. The pipeline leverages tools such as Jenkins, Docker, Apache Airflow, MLflow, and Kubernetes to streamline model management, version control, and ensure continuous delivery in production environments.

Key Features:

CI/CD Integration: The pipeline integrates with Jenkins to automate the training, testing, and deployment of models. Jenkins orchestrates the entire workflow, from pulling the latest code to deploying models in production environments.
Containerization: The use of Docker ensures that all components (MLflow, Flask application, Airflow, etc.) are containerized, providing a consistent environment across different stages of development.
Model Management: Models are trained and tracked with MLflow for version control and experiment tracking. Models can be deployed and monitored with easy rollback to previous versions if necessary.
Orchestration with Airflow: Apache Airflow is used to orchestrate the entire workflow, including data ingestion, model training, and model deployment tasks. DAGs are set up to automate different stages of the machine learning lifecycle.
AWS Integration: The project integrates with AWS S3 for storage of training data and model artifacts.
